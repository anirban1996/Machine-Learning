1. Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques.
It’s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

2. Logistic regression is a fundamental classification technique. 
It belongs to the group of linear classifiers and is somewhat similar to polynomial and linear regression. 
Logistic regression is fast and relatively uncomplicated, and it’s convenient for you to interpret the results. 
Although it’s essentially a method for binary classification, it can also be applied to multiclass problems.

3. A Decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.

4. Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees.
